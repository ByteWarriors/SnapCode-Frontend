## Bringing developers closer; Fostering community and a helping hand.

During these uncertain times, we are getting virtually more connected than ever. We would love to extend this connection to the world of development by helping those with less-than-desirable resources. There still is a huge portion of the student population with not enough online infrastructure to continue learning online.
With our application, we aim to make writing and compiling code easier. In places where Internet connectivity and bandwidth are not reliable, students can write down their code and upload an image of it to our application. The code will get read and converted to text input. It can then be executed as a program and the output can be viewed instantaneously. The whole process consumes very less data and requires less bandwidth.

### How to Run

- Clone this repository to your local machine. 
- Open terminal of choice and navigate to the cloned repository.
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
- Once the server is running, open the React App on http://localhost:3000

Now, the React app is running and the application can be used locally.

Through this application, we hope to bridge the digital gap and help those with inadequate resources to fully explore and master coding practices.
